        "about": "As an experienced freelancer and developer, I have worked on a variety of projects that have honed my skills in mobile app development, machine learning, and backend development.\n\nFrom January 2020 to May 2022, I worked as a freelance Flutter developer, where I developed cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter and Dart programming language. I gained experience working with a wide range of clients, from small businesses to large corporations, and was responsible for building high-quality mobile apps that met their specific business needs.\n\nFrom May 2022 to December 2022, I worked at iCreate as a Flutter developer, where I was responsible for building cross-platform apps and defining the architecture of the project. I also communicated with clients to understand their requirements and suggested new features to increase revenue. I worked collaboratively with backend developers and UI/UX designers to ensure seamless integration of the project.\n\nIn the meantime, I also worked as a freelance machine learning engineer, where I developed machine learning models for clients. This allowed me to develop a strong foundation in data analysis and modeling.\n\nCurrently, I am working as a backend Django developer and machine learning engineer as a freelancer, where I am responsible for building high-quality backend systems and developing machine learning models. With my extensive experience and skills, I am committed to delivering outstanding results for my clients.",
